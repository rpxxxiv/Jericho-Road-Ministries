        It only took an hour to get about 200 children signed up to receive Christmas gifts and clothes from Richland's Jericho Road Ministries this December.<br />
        Executive Director Amy Schultz, the nonprofit's executive director, described the registration as "overwhelming."<br />
        More than two hours before the registration began Thursday night, she said, they already had families lining up outside their offices.<br />

        I am convinced that our created selves are formed in ways that are remarkably resilient. The human body can heal itself and regenerate 
        parts of itself in ways that are nothing less than a miracle. It can withstand unmentionable injury and find ways to compensate for lasting weaknesses. <br />
        But then there are those times our bodies are profoundly fragile. One wrong little substance introduced, one injury to just the right body part 
        and a cascade of breakdown removes the vitality of life.

        There are moments when I ask God a hard question.  “Why do I fall in love with broken people?”  And I wonder what 
        is it inside of me that draws me to the broken ones like a magnet.  I wrestle with deep emotions that stir within 
        me when I look on the chaos of their lives and my heart weeps.  My heart hurts and my body eventually follows suit. <br />
        I go too far, you know.  I get too involved.  I let them in too close. My boundaries are not firm enough.  Some say 
        the balance of work/family/ministry/self is out of whack.  And I ask, “How can that be truth?”
