    <hr />

    <p class="centered">
        Jericho Road Ministries works with local Christian churches, community based agencies and local businesses 
        to resource needs in our local area.  JRM provides minor case management that includes screening and assessment, 
        making appropriate referrals to community resources and programs.  We also provide support services to church 
        benevolence programs that include screening to ensure client needs are legitimate, training and networking 
        opportunities and a fee-based case management system.
    </p>
    <p class="centered">
        Working together, we can provide for legitimate needs without duplicating services. This ensures good stewardship 
        of our resources while sharing badly needed goods and support to less-fortunate families that live around us.
    </p>
    <p class="centered">
        We believe all persons are created in the image of God, and as such are worthy of dignity and respect.  It is our 
        goal to help people find hope and a sense of worth as they come in for help.  With the help of many volunteers we 
        spend time with each person, listening to their story and helping them find ways to be a part of their own solution.
    </p>
    <p class="centered">
        If your church is interested in becoming a partner, or if you are interested in volunteering <a href="Contact.html">contact us</a>.  
        I look forward to visiting with you to see what your interests are and how you can plug in to support local families!
