        Churches are the backbone of our existence!  Churches may send monthly pledges as a part of their outreach or 
        missions for their local community.  Speakers are available to bring a message to your congregation or missions team.  
        Very often, a love offering is taken when a JRM speaker shares a message.  These funds help us keep going! Supply 
        drives such as a toy drive at Christmas or a personal hygiene drive help us supply our programs for people in need.

        Volunteer Work
    </p>
    <p>
        Volunteers are a critical part of helping us have a deeper impact on clients. They are often one of the most overlooked 
        means of being a partner.
